								<p>I’m born and bred in Queensland but am now currently living in Johannesburg, South Africa. I completed my school career at Barcaldine State School at the end of Grade 11 and left school early to pursue my career in IT as a traineeship position opened at The Department of Main Roads, this is where I studied my Cert 2 in IT through Tafe. I’m a 35 year old father of 2, who works full time for a hotel chain where I see to all their IT needs. My personal interests are gaming, travel, golf, cricket and rugby league. I’ve recently started a stream on Twitch TV where I broadcast casual gaming with friends as a fun hobby.</p>

								<p>I have always had a keen interest in all things tech and like to keep up with what is happening in the world of Technology, both regarding hardware and software. I have always enjoyed understanding how things work, whether it was taking apart an old computer or looking at the source code of how a website was built. My interest in the world of IT started at a young age, when my parents bought me an old 86, that was around the time the 486 were released. The 86 was not working and I managed to get it up and running, I was around 11 years old at the time. This really sparked my keen interest in IT and a foundation of where I saw my future.</p>
								<p>As mentioned earlier, I left school early and took up a position at the Department of Main Roads in a trainee position in their IT department and I have worked various jobs in the IT industry since then which include ………
								I have always wanted to complete my Batchelor’s degree in Information Technology and getting my degree will open my scope to move onto bigger and better things in the world of IT. 
								I chose to do my studies through RMIT as I can study online, part time while still being able to work full time.</p>
								<p>I expect to get the formal education required for me to complete my Bachelor’s degree in Information Technology which will give me a solid understanding of IT, thus opening my scope to move up in the IT industry in the future.</p>

								<h2>Where can I watch that?</h2>
								<p>My project idea comes from my own needs as I travel a lot. Their have been more then a handful of times that I have been in the middle of series on Netflix or another streaming but when I get to that country the series is no longer offered on Netflix in that country or the streaming service simply doesn’t work outside particular countries. My project idea is for an app that will allow you to search for a TV series or Movie and shows you what services it is available on in that particular country.</p>
								<p>There are over a million international travellers worldwide every day that have the potential of this exact same situation happening to them, I have even ran into this problem where I was enjoying a series while I was overseas working and when I got back to my home, it wasn’t available on my local Netflix library. This app could also be used to choose which streaming you would like to sign up as it would show you where your favourite series are on which streaming services as the market becomes oversaturated. </p>
