								<p>I was born in Bundaberg, Queensland and moved as a young boy to Central West Queensland but am currently living in Johannesburg, South Africa. I completed my school career at Barcaldine State School at the end of Grade 11 and left school early to pursue my career in IT as a traineeship position opened at The Department of Main Roads, this is where I studied my Cert 2 in IT through Tafe. I’m a 35-year-old father of 2, who works full time for a hotel chain where I see to all their IT needs. My personal interests are gaming, travel, golf, cricket and rugby league. I’ve recently started a stream on Twitch TV where I broadcast casual gaming with friends as a fun hobby.</p>

								<p>I have always had a keen interest in all things tech and like to keep up with what is happening in the world of Technology, both regarding hardware and software. I have always enjoyed understanding how things work, whether it was taking apart an old computer or looking at the source code of how a website was built. My interest in the world of IT started at a young age, when my parents bought me an old 86, that was around the time the 486 were released. The 86 was not working and I managed to get it up and running, I was around 11 years old at the time. This sparked my keen interest in IT and a foundation of where I saw my future.</p>
								<p>As mentioned earlier, I left school early and took up a position at the Department of Main Roads in a trainee position in their IT department and I have worked various jobs in the IT industry since then which include 7 years at The Department of Main Roads following my initial traineeship in the IT department, 6 years as an IT Administrator for a Hotel chain.
								I have always wanted to complete my Batchelor’s degree in Information Technology and getting my degree will open my scope to move onto bigger and better things in the world of IT. 
								I chose to do my studies through RMIT as I can study online, part-time while still being able to work full time.</p>
								<p>I expect to get the formal education required for me to complete my Bachelor’s degree in Information Technology which will give me a solid understanding of IT, thus opening my scope to move up in the IT industry in the future.</p>

								<h2>Myers-Briggs Type Indicator</h2>
								
								<h3>COMMANDER ENTJ-A</h3>
								<img class="picture" src="gates.png" heigh="100" width="100" alt="Bill Gates" align="right">
								<p>I am extremely happy to find out I have the Commander(ENTJ-A) personality as many tech icons have this personality type including Bill Gates and Steve Jobs.
								<h4>Strengths</h4>
								<p><strong>Efficient</strong> – Commanders see inefficiency not just as a problem in its own right, but as something that pulls time and energy away from all their future goals, an elaborate sabotage consisting of irrationality and laziness. People with the Commander personality type will root out such behaviour wherever they go.</p>
								<p>Energetic – Rather than finding this process taxing Commanders are energized by it, genuinely enjoying leading their teams forward as they implement their plans and goals.</p>
								<p>Self-Confident – Commanders couldn’t do this if they were plagued by self-doubt – they trust their abilities, make known their opinions, and believe in their capacities as leaders.</p>
								<p>Strong-Willed – Nor do they give up when the going gets tough – Commander personalities strive to achieve their goals, but really nothing is quite as satisfying to them as rising to the challenge of each obstacle in their run to the finish line.</p>
								<p>Strategic Thinkers – Commanders exemplify the difference between moment-to-moment crisis management and navigating the challenges and steps of a bigger plan, and are known for examining every angle of a problem and not just resolving momentary issues, but moving the whole project forward with their solutions.</p>
								<p>Charismatic and Inspiring – These qualities combine to create individuals who are able to inspire and invigorate others, who people actually want to be their leaders, and this, in turn, helps Commanders to accomplish their often ambitious goals that could never be finished alone.</p>
</p>
								<h4>Weaknesses</h4>
								<p>Stubborn and Dominant – Sometimes all this confidence and willpower can go too far, and Commanders are all too capable of digging in their heels, trying to win every single debate and pushing their vision, and theirs alone.</p>
								<p>Intolerant – “It’s my way or the highway” – People with the Commander personality type are notoriously unsupportive of any idea that distracts from their primary goals, and even more so of ideas based on emotional considerations. Commanders won’t hesitate a second to make that fact clear to those around them.</p>
								<p>Impatient – Some people need more time to think than others, an intolerable delay to quick-thinking Commanders. They may misinterpret contemplation as stupidity or disinterest in their haste, a terrible mistake for a leader to make.</p>
								<img class="picture" src="steve_jobs.png" heigh="250" width="150" alt="Steve Jobs" align="right">
								<p>Arrogant – Commander personalities respect quick thoughts and firm convictions, their own qualities, and look down on those who don’t match up. This relationship is a challenge for most other personality types who are perhaps not timid in their own right, but will seem so beside overbearing Commanders.</p>
								<p>Poor Handling of Emotions – All this bluster, alongside the assumed supremacy of rationalism, makes Commanders distant from their own emotional expression and sometimes downright scornful of others’. People with this personality type often trample others’ feelings, inadvertently hurting their partners and friends, especially in emotionally charged situations.</p>
								<p>Cold and Ruthless – Their obsession with efficiency and unwavering belief in the merits of rationalism, especially professionally, makes Commanders incredibly insensitive in pursuing their goals, dismissing personal circumstances, sensitivities, and preferences as irrational and irrelevant.</p>
</p>
								
								
								<h2>Big 5 Personality</h2>
							
								<p>In terms of my results for the Big Five personality traits test, I scored high in Extroversion, moderate in Emotional stability and Conscientiousness and low on Intellect/Imagination and Agreeableness.
								These results show some consistency with the results of the Myers Briggs test as they show that I have good leadership abilities and it also shows that I work well in a group situation, as I enjoy being with people and working with them.</p>
								<img src="big5testresult.png" heigh="300" width="600" alt="Big5 Test Result"/>
								
								<h2>Which Rick & Morty Character Am I?</h2>
								<img  src="rickmortytest.png" heigh="500" width="500"  alt="Rick & Morty Test Result" class="center"/>
								
								<p>Need I say more?</p>

								<h2>What do these results mean for me?</h2>
								<p>My Myers Briggs test result shows me to have a Commander personality type. This shows that I am efficient and energetic, these are good traits as they put me in a position to work in the best and most streamlined manner and I am energised by being able to implement my plans and goals. I am also strong-willed and don’t give up, I find rising to challenges very satisfying. Having this personality type allows me to be able to take charge and control any project well. My ability to be a strategic thinker allows me to solve problems by looking at the different angles of the problem and move a project forward.</p>
								<h2>How I think these results may influence my behaviour in a team</h2>
								<p>As my personality type is charismatic and inspiring, I am well suited to leading a team in such a manner that we are able to complete the type of goal together that one could not accomplish on your own. I am a good judge of different personalities and that would assist me in putting the correct group of people together where we are able to each use our relevant skills in order to reach our common goal. Although I can be quite domineering, I need to keep an open mind towards the ideas of the other team members in a team situation so that the best possible result is achieved in completing a project.</p>
								<h2>How I should take this into account when forming a team</h2>
								<p>When forming a team, the different aspects of a project should be allocated to someone who is suitable for that particular task. In a team situation, I should take each members strengths and abilities into account and use the necessary care and discretion when dealing with other personality types. </p>

					<div class="sectionTitles"><h1>Project Idea</h1></div>
					<div class="sectionContent">
							<article>
								<h2>Where can I watch that?</h2>
								<p>My project idea is for a website/app called “Where Can I Watch That?”. The purpose of this website/app is to enable users who travel frequently to still continue to watch a series or particular movie they may be following or watching at home while they are away. </p>
								<p>The idea for my project comes from my own experience as I am a frequent traveller and often find myself in another country. I enjoy watching series on Netflix or other streaming platforms as a pastime and there have been more than a handful of times where I have been away and would like to continue watching a particular series I have been following, but when I go on Netflix or try to access my other streaming services in that region or country, they may not work there. I have also found that the bouquet offered on Netflix differs from country to country, meaning that even though a particular series is available when I’m home, the Netflix service in that country might carry a different selection of series and the one I am looking for is not on the list.</p>
								<p>My project would thus be an app that allows you to search for a television series and/or movie while in a certain region which would show you what services are available to watch on in that particular country. </p>
								<p>International travel has become much more common over the years both for leisure and business, and continues to grow. This can be seen by a study done by the World Travel Organisation, the research shows the increase in travel between 1950 and has predictions to 2030. It can be seen that in 1950 there was little or no regular travel but by 2030 international travel will increase to around 1.8 billion people travelling annually.</p>
								 
								<img  src="internationalflights.png" heigh="500" width="500"  alt="International Flights" class="center"/>
								<p>Thus there are millions of international travellers worldwide every day and they could potentially find themselves in a similar situation while they are abroad.</p>
								<p>I have even run into the situation that, while I was away, I found and was enjoying a series, only to find that upon my return home and on the streaming platforms I subscribe to, the series is not available in their libraries. This situation can be very frustrating when looking for something you enjoy watching.</p>
								<p>Another purpose that this app could be used for is to select the most suitable streaming service to subscribe to and which one fits your needs the best and offers what you are looking for. There are numerous different streaming services available in each country and the market is quite competitive and saturated and it could be confusing to select which one to choose with so many options available.</p>
								<img src="search.png" class="center2" height="400" width="250" alt="Search"/> 
								<img src="results_page.png" class="center2" height="400" width="250" alt="Results Page"/>
								<h3>Tools & Technologies</h3>
								<p>There are multiple tools and technologies I can use to develop this application.</p>
								<p>The use of Progressive Web Apps (PWA) will keep development costs low while maintaining cross-platform capabilities.</p>
								<p>The project requires a large database of information, in this case, I have decided to use Microsoft SQL database while the frontend will be HTML/CSS/Javascript. The database and the website frontend will be hosted on Microsoft Azure servers.</p>
								<p>Microsft Visual Studio 2019 is the tool that I will use to complete the entirety of this project.
								<h3>Skills Required</h3>
								<ul class="keySkills">	
								<li>HTML</li>
								<li>CSS</li>
								<li>Javascript</li>
								<li>Microsft SQL</li>
								<li>Visual Studio 2019</li>
								</ul>
								<p></p>
								<h3>Outcome</h3>
								<p>A minimum viable product will be a selection of shows which will show you where they can be watched in a selection of countries. The progression of this website/app would be the expanding of the database allowing the cataloguing of many more shows/movies which would then make adding a search function much more viable. Once the database has expanded to a large enough selection the next step would be to add further countries to the list.</p>
								<p>I will have one single website that will accessible from all browsers and installed as a PWA app on mobile devices running either Android or iOS.</p>
